<p><strong>To Play, or Not to Playâ€¦</strong></p>

<p>Dead Ends by Kottia Spangler, Division Umpire</p>
<p>The definition of a dead end can be found on page 33 of the <a href="documents/Crystal_Mark_Second_Edition.pdf">"Laws of the Sport of Bowls"</a> (LOSB). Often, the bowlers in the daily club draw will opt to not replay a dead end. This is often perceived as an attempt to move the game along in order to finish within a specified amount of time. However, if you have a dead end declared in your game, follow rule 31.4 of the LOSB.</p>

<p>In handling dead ends there are basically three options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) &nbsp;Replay the dead end following rule 31<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) &nbsp;Mark the end as played with no score<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) &nbsp;Finish the end following rule 15.5 (re-spotting the jack)</p>

<p>These options should be used only if declared prior to the start of the game. Option #3 is usually only used in tournament set-play, but can be used in other games with agreement by both skips/teams. </p>
