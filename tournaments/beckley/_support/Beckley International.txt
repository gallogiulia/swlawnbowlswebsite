One Word "Wet"
 
I think many people will look back and say that was the wettest day I have ever bowled (hopefully fondly). It was a shortened tournament to only 2 rounds of a scheduled 4 rounds.
 
We had quite a few people that wanted to keep bowling but it was pretty nasty weather. A bad day of bowling is still a good day!
