<p><strong><u>October 16, 2019 Ladies Day at Casta del Sol</u></strong></p>
<p>Ladies Day was held at Casta del Sol in Mission Viejo.    A special thank you to Denise French and Dottie Lewis, along with other club members for their hospitality.  We had wonderful breakfast items and salads for lunch, along with the delicious sweets.  Of course I can&rsquo;t forget to thank them for the ice cream bars which were certainly welcomed after a warm day of bowling.  The greens at Casta del Sol were great to play on, it was so nice to have them back in the loop.<br>
<br>
We were delighted to have first time Ladies&rsquo; Day bowlers join us:  Joann Reinhold (Casta del Sol), Amy Chan (Casta del Sol), not first time but we convinced her to bowl with us after a long hiatis, Val Blackholly, Trish Soto, Beverly Ponder, Chris Quinn (Laguna Beach) and Karen Slack (visiting from Scotland).<br>
<br>
I want to give a big thank you to Tracy Manzi from Laguna Beach for personally speaking to Laguna <br>
Beach members and inviting them to Ladies&rsquo; Day.  Every club needs a Tracy.</p>

<p><strong><u>August 21, 2019 Ladies Day at Laguna Beach</u></strong></p>
<p>Ladies Day was held at the Laguna Beach LBC. We had a great turnout with 30 ladies. FABULOUS HOSPITALITY (capitalized because it was like a catered affair). Upon arrival there was a magnificent selection of home cooked, home grown and beautifully presented breakfast. Everything prepared by Madeleine McLendon . Not only breakfast was prepared, but she also served an amazing lunch with delicious desserts (homemade of course). Besides the food, I also need to thank those members who helped set up for the day.<br>
<br>
We were delighted to have the following Ladies attend Ladies’ Day for the First time.<br>
KAREN BILLON, SUSAN DENTON, MARYANN STULZ, ADRIANNE THOMAS, JANICE WALTER<br><br>

Hope to see you all at the next one.<br>

<p><strong><u>December 18, 2018 Ladies Day at Laguna Woods</u></strong></p>
<p>What a wonderful day for bowling.  Tis the season to have fun and our SWWD Holiday party and Ladies Day bowling was hosted by Laguna Woods LBC.  Everyone was decked out in their holiday attire and 44 Ladies came early to bowl and more came later for the lunch.  The greens at Laguna Woods are terrific, such an improvement since they redid their carpet.<br>
<br>
Laguna Woods hospitality did a great job with our morning nourishment and then we went to Clubhouse 2 for a great lunch with holiday decorations on every table.  Everyone had a great time socializing, eating and drinking.  To add to the excitement several  lucky ladies won raffle prizes.<br><br>

Thanks to Margi Rambo, Linda Roberts  and Jane Blair who helped Diana Wenzel and myself (Shelley Cohen) with the  raffle tickets.  Thanks to Micky Alexander for checking in everyone at the luncheon, since Diana and I were still working on the prize money for the bowling and couldn&rsquo;t be in 2 places at the same time.  </p>
