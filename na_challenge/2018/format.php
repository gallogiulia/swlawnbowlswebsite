<h1>FORMAT</h1>

<p>Each country fields teams of 10 women and 10 men. Each team is designated into 2 squads of 5 women and 5 men, one Folkins and one Jarvis for each gender, a total of 4 squads per country. Each gender-specific squad plays the 2 squads from the opposing country. The better finishing squads of each country then play in the 3rd round of their discipline, and the other squads face each other.</p>

<p>The order of play is the International standard, with each 5-player squad playing 3 matches of Pairs and Triples in the first disciplines, followed by the second disciplines of 3 matches of Singles and Fours. In the 1st round the US Folkins teams play the Canadian Folkins teams and the US Jarvis teams play the Canadian Jarvis teams. In the 2nd round the US Folkins teams play the Canadian Jarvis teams and the US Jarvis teams play the Canadian Folkins teams. The 3rd round is described above, where high squad plays high, and low plays low.</p>

<p>At the end of the NAC, each individual player has played 6 matches. Overall, 48 matches are played over 3 days. There are 7 trophies, all determined by most wins, with plus points as the tiebreaker. There are Folkins and Jarvis trophies for both the men and the women, Folkins and Jarvis trophies for the combined genders, and an overall NAC trophy.</p>
