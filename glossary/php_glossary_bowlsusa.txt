//this script provides a highlighted box and content IF a controlling file ("ann00.txt") exists - the script is bypassed without that file
//a simple way to turn it on or off is to rename the file - I easily do it by adding or removing a character at the end of the filename

$data = file_get_contents('http://bowlsusa.us/glossary/terms.html');     // searches for the file in the uslba directory and captures its contents

// if($data)                                        if the above operation found the file with data, the remaining steps are followed
