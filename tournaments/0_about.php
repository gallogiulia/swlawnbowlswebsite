This file is a template for the "About" feature on tournament pages.
This file should be copied to the specific tournament directory listing, renaming it "about.php".
A script in the tournament PHP file looks for this file. If it's found, an "About" link will appear and
open a browser window with this content. If none exists, no button will appear.
Edit this file as a normal PHP page.
The size and location of the pop-up browser window can be specified in the scrip on the tournament page.
