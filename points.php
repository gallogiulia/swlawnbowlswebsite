<h1>DIVISION POINTS</h1>
<p>New in 2014, a points sytem is in place for all tournaments that are open to both men and women. Each player earns points based on their team's position in the tournament and other criteria. The more tournaments a person enters, the more points he/she will accumulate. One dollar of the entry fee at all qualifying events will be placed in a pool that will be awarded to the players who attain the highest point totals at the end of the season.</p>
<p>This system is separate from the men's and women's standings that award points for performance in selected SWWD and SWLBA tournaments {see the Standings (M) and Standings (W) links}.</p>
<p>These standings will be updated shortly after each event.</p>
