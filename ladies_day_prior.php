<p><strong><u>December 20, 2017 Ladies' Day at Laguna Woods</u></strong></p>
<p>Ladies Day was at the Laguna Woods Lawn Bowling Club with a fun day of bowling and followed by our Holiday Luncheon. </p>
<p> We had a great turnout with over 56 ladies bowling from several clubs and 83 attending the luncheon. Many thanks to Ellie Orewyler for allowing us access to the clubhouse and organizing the greens and feeding us goodies before bowling. Laguna Woods served a beautiful lunch with very generous portions and it was so nice to be in the clubhouse 2 again. Everything ran smoothly thanks to Sheila Conti and Diana Wenzel who took care of the raffle. </p>
<p> A very special thanks to Ginger and Randy Hatfield (fellow lawn bowlers) for the beautiful entertainment during our luncheon. What a terrific treat to have two professionals entertain us with holiday music.<br>

The greens were set up when we arrived and Holmby hospitality certainly knows how to please our palate with a beautiful lunch and then by ending the day with ice cream sandwiches.   A big thanks  for such a warm welcome.<br>

<h3>March 15, 2017 Ladies' Day at Santa Anita</h3>

<p>Our first Ladies Day of the year was held at Santa Anita.  We had a great turnout with 26 ladies from ten <strong>(WOW)</strong> clubs (Beverly Hills, The Groves, Holmby Park, Laguna Beach, Long Beach, Newport Harbor, Pomona, Redlands, Riverside and Santa Anita).  It was wonderful to have ladies join us for their first time at Ladies' Day.
<br>
The hospitality group from Santa Anita did a great job.  There was a beautiful selection of food and drinks.  The added touch of serving us ice cream was terrific.  The greens were set up when we arrived and cold water bottles were in the cooler.  Santa Anita has been working hard on their greens and it certainly shows.</p>

<h3>December 14, 2016 Ladies' Day Christmas/Bowling Luncheon at Laguna Woods</h3>
<p>This year, I think because Laguna Woods only had one green available, the turnout was a little smaller than last year. We had 40 bowlers – 6 triples & 1 double – and a total of 66 ladies for the luncheon. There were quite a few ladies attending for the first time and I think they found out what a fun time we have and will feel compelled to join us when we start up again next year.</p>
<p>I took several pictures, which are included here, both at bowling & the luncheon. Most everyone was decked out in casual Holiday attire, some with Santa Hats as you will see.</p>
<p>We had a tie for first place – a double & a triple. They were:
 <br>
 <span class="indent_30"><strong>Margi Rambo & Sandra Schlosser</strong></span><strong><br>
 <span class="indent_30">Diana Wenzel, Karen Sando & Donna O’Brien.</span></strong></p>
<p>Second Place went to:<br>
 <strong><span class="indent_30">Colleen Jenkins, Denise French & Kay Hudnall</span></strong></p>
<p>CONGRATS to you all !!</p>
<p>Ellie Orewyler did a great job, as usual, arranging the luncheon for our enjoyment. The dining room was all set up for us with Poinsettias on each table, which were won by someone at each of the tables & we had lots of presents that were donated by our attendees & raffled off. With a little bit of wine to get the afternoon started, the meal was served & was delicious.</p>
<p>See you all at the next Ladies' Day in March at Santa Anita !! <br>

<h3>November 16, 2016 Ladies' Day at Sun City</h3>

<p>Ladies' Day was held at Sun City Lawn Bowl. We had a great turnout with 17 ladies from six different clubs (Casta Del Sol, Hemet, Long Beach, Newport Harbor, Redlands and Sun City). It was wonderful to see four ladies join us for their first time at Ladies' Day -- Karen LaCroix, Adriana Sandoval, Margaret Six and Barbara Sweeney. A Special thanks to those who traveled far to attend Ladies' Day in Sun City.</p>

<p>The hospitality group of both men and women from Sun City did a great job. There was a nice display of food. The greens were set up when we arrived and cold water bottles were in the cooler. Everyone had a really fun day with beautiful weather.<br>

<p>Ladies' Day was held at the Laguna Beach Lawn Bowling Club where everyone enjoyed the beautiful ocean view.</p>

<p>We had a great turnout with over 36 ladies from several clubs. Many thanks to Madeleine McClenson for her amazing breakfast. Everyone was so complementary of the delicious food as well as its beautiful presentation. Sheila Conti and Collen Jenkins did their usual great job at providing the type of hospitality that makes LBLBC such a special place.</p>

<p>Thanks to Diana Wenzel for her help, I couldn’t have done it without her.</p>

<p>The morning started with a “Spider” which was won by Sharon Grady.

<h3>July 20, 2016 Ladies' Day at Santa Ana</h3>

<p>Ladies' Day at the Santa Ana LBC didn’t start out on a positive note. Norma Goodhart had a mishap as she was coming down the stairs carrying her bowling bag & briefcase, with all the things needed to put this event on. Unfortunately, she fell & broke a bone in her left foot. I’m so glad that I was there to keep everything going when she had to go home. Although I was a little rusty there were several others there to fill in what I forgot to say! Thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p>Norma wanted me to thank Tom, President of Santa Ana LBC, for all his help. And with the help of several other gentlemen, the green was set up for the five rinks that we required for pairs – 20 ladies bowling. The hospitality team, led by Lenora, did an outstanding job both for the morning snacks and lunch extras - they even topped it off with root beer floats!.</p>
 
<p>Because it was supposed to be HOT it was decided that we would only bowl in the morning. So after lunch, five prizes were given out. We had 1st, 2nd, 3rd and a tie for 4th. I don’t have all the names because all of that information is in the briefcase that was taken back to Norma for next time. But you know who you are, so congrats! Then instead of leaving it at that we had two spiders before everyone left.</p>

<p>I think everyone had a good day and it was good getting an early start home ahead of the usual heavy traffic. We hope that Norma’s foot will heal properly and she won’t have to be away from bowling for too long.</p>

<p>The next Ladies' Day will be at Laguna Beach, which as you know is a beautiful location. So put the date on your calendar – August 17th.</p>

<p>Micky Alexander<br><br></p>

<h3>June 15, 2016 Ladies' Day at Holmby Park</h3>

<p>Ladies' Day was held at Holmby Park with all their beautiful landscaping.  We had a great turnout with over 20 ladies from several clubs.  Even though many drove far to be there, it was definitely worth the drive.</p>

<p>The greens were set up when we arrived and Holmby certainly knows how to set out a fantastic variety of food.  Starting from breakfast items of fruit, eggs and coffee cake, pastries and even string cheese.  Along with their coffee, they served hot tea (Norma was very happy).  Then came out the lunch food.  Wow, what a variety of salads, side dishes, fruit, and desserts galore.  Their members just kept bringing their homemade foods – yummy.   A big thanks to the Hospitality of Holmby Park for such a warm welcome.</p>

<h3>December 9, 2015 Ladies' Day Holiday Luncheon at Laguna Woods</h3>

<p>This year's Ladies' Day get togethers came to a grand conclusion at Laguna Woods. There were 65 of us, some for the luncheon only but most also came out to bowl. We could see that the greens were set up for us as we came in from the parking lot and there was good hot coffee and lots of goodies that we partook of while visiting, before the game.</p>
<p>There were a few mix ups getting everyone in the right place to bowl because a few ladies were unable to attend at the last minute. However, with the help of a very able assistant, Nancy Doss, the games were under way. It took a few minutes, after I finished bowling, to figure out the winners. But, again, I had help. This time it was Nancy, Norma Goodhart and Shelly Cohen. Appreciate it gals!</p>
<p>The winners of the game were:<br>
</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
 <th>1st </th>
 <td>Margi Rambo</td>
 <td>Ginny Kelly</td>
 <td>Diana Wenzel</td>
 </tr>

 <th>2nd (tie)</th>
 <td>Mary Thompson</td>
 <td>Barbara Gervase</td>
 <td>Norma Goodhart</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <th>2nd (tie)</th>
 <td>Dee McSparran</td>
 <td>Pat Martinez</td>
 <td>Mary Spease</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>After the congratulations and pictures were taken we all headed to Clubhouse 5 for the official Holiday Luncheon. It was beautifully set up for us complete with a fitting tribute to Izzie Forbes.</p>
<p>Raffle tickets were being sold and purchased at a rapid rate for all the beautifully wrapped gifts that filled up a couple of long tables. There were a few announcements made and a BIG thank you given by Pat Gonzales, President of the SWWD for the last two years, to Ellie Orewyler, who arranged all of this for us. While we were served the delicious lunch and having some wine, the raffle got underway, a few now and then interspersed throughout the event. We were also entertained by Joey Simms, a very funny comedian, who happens to live in Laguna Woods and arranged for us by Jeannie LeRoy. As you can tell, a lot goes in to putting this day together.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has lent a hand, helping me conduct the Ladies' Days for these past two years. I have enjoyed it so much and have met &amp; made some lasting friendships, which is at the heart of this game of Lawn Bowling!</p>
<p>See you on the greens!!</p>

<h3>November 18, 2015 Ladies' Day at Sun City</h3>

<p>A beautiful day was had by all at Sun City. The group was small but mighty!! The green was set up for us by our great setup crew and the goodies spread out for breakfast started us out on the right foot. The previous Sunday, at our tournament, it was SO cold that we thought soup would be great for Ladies' Day. Well, wouldn't you know it, Sun City lived up to it's name on Wednesday but the Chicken Tortilla soup for lunch, hit the spot anyway.</p>
<p>In the morning game we had only 2 triples and 1 double but we paid 3 winners so someone from each game won! And the winners were:</p>


<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Jo Ann LaFrenais</td>
<td>Amy Chan</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>
<td>Joanne Hedgespeth</td>
<td>Linda Blanche</td>
<td>Jan Bailey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Place</th>
<td>Shelly Rosenberg</td>
<td>Mary Thompson</td>
<td>Denise French</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>We had a leisurely lunch with the gentlemen graciously serving us and then cleaning up while we went on to bowl the second game. With 1 triple &amp; 2 doubles the winners were:</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Gail Hodgson, </td>
<td>Amy Chan</td>
<td>Denise French</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>
<td>Jo Ann LaFrenais</td>
<td>Peggy Cowherd</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Plac<em>e</em></th>
<td>Joanne Hedgespeth</td>
<td>Sarah Case</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Our next get together will be the last one for the year and it's the Christmas Holiday Luncheon and bowling. Yes, it's that time of the year - can you believe it?!? I sure hope you have all posted the Holiday flyer, signup sheet &amp; map at your club. If not, go to website, print it out &amp; get it up there! As you know, payment for this event is $12.00, which includes both the bowling &amp; luncheon. I have already received a couple checks but I must know if they are bowling or just coming to the luncheon. Please let your members know that when they send me their money to include a note to that effect &amp; if they are bowling, what position they prefer &amp; what club they are from. Or to make sure their names are on the signup sheet with that information.</p>
<p>The names off all those we know of, whether bowling or luncheon only, must be to me early on Thursday, December 3rd. I have to send them to Laguna Woods that afternoon so that Ellie can get the information to the gate staff. I can still accept a few more through December 5th but none after that date.</p>
<p>Last year we had a great turnout - let's see if we can do it again. Remember, it's Holiday Casual dress but flat soled shoes if you're bowling. And bring some extra $ (dollars) so that you can buy lots of raffle tickets for all the great wrapped gifts that we're all going to donate. this all benefits the SWWD. It's going to be a fun day so encourage everyone to join us.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!</p>

I arrived about 8:30, in plenty of time to check everyone in but Sharon Grady continued the task because I had asked her to be there in case I was late - the traffic being what it is! This gave me the opportunity to show Norma Goodhart &amp; Shelley Cohen the ropes. They were a great help in getting everything set up for the day.</p>

<p>The coffee was on with lots of breakfast items available to taste, which is so appreciated. The green was all set up with the 6 rinks I had requested but then a few changes had to be made so we needed one more rink &amp; it was quickly handled.</p>

<p>After a few announcements our picture was taken by Jerry Grady, which is attached. This event is always a blind draw so names were called, the teams set up &amp; the game got underway. As is usually the case we award the top three winners &amp; they are as follows:<br>
</p>

<table width="740" class="results_3">

<td>Norma Goodhart</td>
<td>Eleanor Reafsnyder</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Place</th>
<td>Cecile Langevin</td>
<td>Dottie Lewis</td>
<td>Pashi Vakiva</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>After our lunch break, during which we enjoyed extra goodies along with the lunch we brought, the afternoon game was set up with another draw for teams.&nbsp; There were quite a few ladies that only wanted to bowl in the morning so some additional changes were made.&nbsp; The afternoon game winners were:</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>

<tr>
<th>3rd Plac<em>e</em></th>

</tr>
</table>

<p>There were several fairly new bowlers today and a couple of them were among the winners! Good for them!</p>
<p>The next Ladies' Day is at Sun City LBC on November 18th. I know it's a long distance for some ladies but hopefully it will be a good turnout. So please print out the signup sheet &amp; get it posted at your club.</p>
<p>Don't forget to put December 9th on your calendar - that's our annual Christmas luncheon &amp; bowling at Laguna Woods. You can go to the SW website under Ladies' Day to find the flyer, signup sheet &amp; a map. The map shows 2 different routes that can be taken from Gate 12 to Clubhouse 5, which is where the luncheon will take place this year. Please post these as well.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Newport Harbor Club and to all the ladies for coming. It's a relaxing day where we can provide assistance to those new to the sport and enjoy each other's friendship.</p>
<p>See you next time!</p>

<h3>August 19, 2015' Ladies' Day at Laguna Beach</h3>

<p>What a beautiful location for a lawn bowling club - or for anything, for that matter. I get to watching the ocean &amp; surfers, the vegetation, the birds and hoping the birds don't drop anything on us! So far, so good!!</p>
<p>We had such a successful day with 50 ladies bowling. You wouldn't believe the delicious goodies that were prepared for us - all home baked. The greens were all set up using the numbers that I had asked for, so that my score cards matched the rink numbers. I didn't do that one time before &amp; it was rather confusing.</p>
<p>Before getting started we had another Spider. The jack had lots of movement but when all settled down we had to measure the two closest bowls, with Sheila Conti handling the measuring. And guess who's bowl was the winner - Sheila's!! I was watching so all was on the up &amp; up!!</p>
<p>Our morning game included four Rinks games &amp; 3 triples. It was the first time I was able to make that work and the first time playing rinks, for some. There were also some ladies playing in positions that were not familiar to them but I think everyone had a wonderful day. AM winners were:</p>

<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Cecile Langevin</td>
<td>Myriam Singer</td>
<td>Shelley Cohen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>
<td>Micky Alexander</td>
<td>Angie Salgado</td>
<td>Nancy Steward</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Place</th>
<td>Linda Blanche</td>
<td>Sally Cadwallader</td>
<td>Helen Dinkus</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>The afternoon game was 7 triples and the winners were::</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Cecile Langevin</td>
<td>Myriam Singer</td>
<td>Shelley Cohen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>
<td>Helen Mathewson</td>
<td>Charlyne Moltane</td>
<td>Helen Michel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Plac<em>e</em></th>
<td>Jan Hargraves</td>
<td>Nancy Steward</td>
<td>Diana Wenzel</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We will be dark for the month of September because of the US Open later that month. So the next Ladies' Day will be on October 14th, at Newport Harbor, which is the second Wednesday because of the National Championships later that month. So while you're thinking about it, print out the flyer for October &amp; get it posted at your club. Let's continue to have a great turn out - it was awesome!!</p>
<p>We are still looking for someone to take over as Ladies' Day Coordinator for next year. It only takes a few days before and a couple afterwards &amp; you're done for the month. So let me know if you are interested &amp; I'll be glad to help you get started.</p>
<p>For now, That's It Folks!! See you on the green &amp; then in Newport in October!!</p>

<h3>July 15, 2015 Ladies' Day at Santa Ana</h3>

<p>It was a long ride getting there but with four of us sharing the ride it went faster.&nbsp; Most everyone else was there and checked in by Angie.&nbsp; Sure appreciated her help.&nbsp; Then I asked Dixie &amp; Linda V. to help by putting out the score cards &amp; chips for the vices &amp; leads.&nbsp; I finalized the set-up of the morning game - 5 triples &amp; 2 pairs, with a few changes that always come up &amp; then I rang the bell!</p>
<p>We had 5 first time attendees who introduced themselves - how long they've been bowling &amp; what club they belong to.&nbsp; So happy to have them join us.&nbsp; I made a few announcements, including thanking all the ladies that set up the greens for us &amp; the hospitality crew.&nbsp; This time, after the Pledge of Allegiance, we had a spider &amp; the winner was Ellie Garcia, one of the new attendees!!!</p>
<p>The results of the first game were:</p>

<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Sally Cadwallader</td>
<td>Norma Goodhart</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>
<td>Dee Mc Sparran</td>
<td>Nancy Tirrell</td>
<td>Helen Michel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd Place</th>
<td>Angie Salgado</td>
<td>Shirley Cooper</td>
<td>Gloria Montez</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>We broke for lunch and all enjoyed the delicious accompaniments to the lunch we brought and before we got underway again, we were given some rules about the game and etiquette/courtesy to remember, by the Bowls USA President, Heather Stewart, who was able to join us this time.&nbsp; She has a way of making the learning of all this information fun, which makes it easier to remember.</p>
<p>The afternoon game was won by the following:</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Angie Salgado</td>
<td>Norma Goodhart</td>
<td>Shelley Cohen</td>
</tr>

<th class="results_tie">(tie)</th>

</table>

<p>Our gentleman photographer, Bob, took a few extra pictures while we were getting ready to bowl, so I've attached a couple of those plus the usual group photo.</p>
<p>Next months Ladies' Day will be at Laguna Beach on August 19th.&nbsp; That is always an enjoyable place to visit, especially this time of the year.&nbsp; So make sure you sign up and come on down!!!</p>

<h3>June 17, 2015 Ladies' Day at Holmby Park</h3>

<p>Another successful and fun day with friends in a beautiful setting. The greens were set up for us by Cecil and John and there was a delightful array of breakfast goodies to entice us.</p>
<p>Cheryl helped by putting out the score cards and chips for drawing the vices and leads so that I had time to finalize the games we enjoyed in the morning - there are always last minute changes to make.</p>
<p>We rang the bell to get everyone's attention so that welcoming remarks could be made. There were a few first time attendees to Ladies' Day. even though some had been bowling for a while. We're glad they could join us and hopefully they had such a good time, they will join us again! </p>
<p>Cheryl and Shirley made the announcement regarding Izzie Forbes' passing and we had a Moment of Silence in her memory.</p>
<p>There were no trial ends - we just got to it! While everyone was visiting and enjoying lunch and the delicious food provided by the hospitality group, led by Linda, the winners were determined and they were:</p>

<h3>May 20, 2015 Ladies' Day at Long Beach</h3>

<p>What a super day we had at Long Beach today.&nbsp; We had the largest turnout since I have been coordinating the event, with the exception of the Christmas luncheon.&nbsp; Ten clubs were represented, with a total of 48 bowlers and I believe there were 4 first time attendees.</p>
<p>The entire green was set up by two of the ladies from Long Beach and a wonderful selection of breakfast items were available for us.&nbsp; I also had help at the check in desk which allowed me to be able to take the time to set up for the blind draw.</p>
<p>I made my opening comments, the new ladies introduced themselves, we had a couple of announcements and after the draw our picture was taken - we all look pretty good!&nbsp; No trial bowls today, we just went for it and it appeared everyone was having a great time.</p>
<p>Since we had 8 triples this AM it was easy to figure the prize money and because there were that many bowlers, we could give out up to 4th place and here they are:</p>

<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Helen Mathewson</td>
<td>Linda Bator</td>
<td>Joan Morris</td>

<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>

<td>Gloria Montez</td>
<td>Kay Hudnall</td>

<tr>
<th>3rd Place</th>

<td>Norma Goodhart</td>
<td>Valerie Seres</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>4th Place</th>
<td>Mary Thompson</td>
<td>Charlyne Moltane</td>
<td>Beanie Ovens</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>After many delicious choices to accompany the lunches we all brought, the second draw for the afternoon game took place.&nbsp; A few ladies couldn't stay for &nbsp;the second game so we had 6 triples &amp; 1 double.&nbsp; And the winners were:</p>
<table width="740" class="results_3">
 <tr>
<th>1st Place</th>
<td>Carol Poto</td>
<td>Cathy MacDonald</td>
<td>Mary Gaiz</td>

<tr>
<th>2nd Place</th>

</table>

<p>As you can see, some of the ladies had a VERY GOOD DAY!!!</p>

<p>The attached picture turned out really good but somehow my camera had yesterdays date, &nbsp;However, we all know it was taken today. We all look happy and eager to get on with it, which we did in short order.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how pleased I was to have such a great crowd and I believe everyone had a fun day.&nbsp; I know I did.</p>

<p>Another fun day of friendship, exercise, fresh air and a little competition.&nbsp; Can't get any better than that!&nbsp; The green was all set up by some phantom guys (they were nowhere to be seen) and the breakfast goodies were abundant and delicious.&nbsp; I understand that the fruit bowl was provided by one of those phantom guys, as well!</p>
<p>I actually arrived early for a change so I had plenty of time to get organized.&nbsp; As soon everyone had checked in we got started.&nbsp; I always have my camera at the ready for our group photo but alas, I could not find it.&nbsp; Before I started my welcome I asked if anyone had seen my camera &amp; in just a moment Jan says 'Is this it?&quot; &nbsp;Where was it?&nbsp; Under my hat!!&nbsp; You can tell how my day started.</p>
<p>We had three gals attending for their first time and hopefully not their last.</p>
<p>With four triples games in the morning these were the winners:</p>

<p>Even though I have to move some people out of their normal position they work with it and get &nbsp;some good experience.&nbsp; That's why these Ladies' Days are so much fun - it's a relaxing day of games, we can try something new without it being stressful and there's a good chance of taking home some prize dollars!!</p>
<p>So plan on joining us at the next Ladies' Day at Casta del Sol on April 22nd.&nbsp; I am attaching the Flyer and it can also be seen &amp; printed from the <a href="http://swlawnbowls.org" target="_blank">swlawnbowls.org</a> website.</p>

<h3>December 10, 2014 Ladies' Holiday Luncheon at Laguna Woods</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Wow! What a great day we had at Laguna Woods!&nbsp; We deviate from our traditional white clothing to Holiday Casual on this occasion which adds to the festivities. There was quite a group of us - 107 ladies in attendance, some for lunch only and some for bowling also.</p>
<p>There were delicious goodies laid out for us and the greens were all set up and with that many people we used almost the whole of both greens.&nbsp; Some ladies had never bowled on this type of surface before, so it was a learning experience for them.</p>
<p>We had two definite winners and they were announced at the luncheon and presented with their prize dollars!&nbsp; I have attached their pictures.</p>


<table width="300" class="results_3">
<tr>
<th class="results_2">1st Place</th>
<td>Jan Hargraves</td>
<td>Jeannie LeRoy</td>
<td>Eula Casselman</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class="results_2">2nd Place</th>
<td>Olga McCord</td>
<td>Oi Ling Kwan</td>
<td>Freddie Hinson</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Freddie is 91 years old and can still hold her own in this game - way to go Freddie!!</p>


<p>We all brought wrapped gifts that we donated to be raffled off, which benefits the SWWD Division. Several ladies took on the task of selling tickets and Cheri Cabot announced the winners.&nbsp; If you had a winning ticket you could go up to the gift table and select anyone of them that appealed to you.</p>




<p>All this took place while we helped ourselves to the wonderful buffet that was set up for us.&nbsp; Ellie Orewyler, again took on the task of getting all the tables set up, complete with a Poinsettia on each, which someone at each table won and was able to take home. She was also responsible for setting up the morning refreshments and letting those that set up the greens for us, know what we needed. Thank you so much from all of us!</p>
<p>Charlyn Moltane played the piano while we ate and then gave us a very funny rendition of a new bowler and everything there is to learn, with helpful hints coming from everywhere! Brought back lots of memories in all of us, I'm sure.</p>
<p>That's it for this year.&nbsp; Next years schedule starts again in March at Santa Anita.&nbsp; I will have the complete schedule available at the AGM for the Delegates to post at their clubs.&nbsp; It's been a great year for me.&nbsp; I have met so many great gals and I look forward to seeing you all in the new year.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your help and your patience as I learned the ins &amp; outs of organizing Ladies' Days.&nbsp; I had so much fun, I'm doing it again for 2015!</p>
<p>MERRY CHRISTMAS and &nbsp;HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL!</p>

<h3>November 19, 2014 Ladies' Day at Sun City</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I said I couldn't promise that we would have good weather but Sun City lived up to it's name - it was a beautiful day indeed.&nbsp; We also had the smiling faces of several gentlemen as they served up the breakfast goodies &amp; lunch that was provided by our Sun City ladies.&nbsp; The maintenance department set up lots of colorful umbrellas around the green and tables on the patio &amp; our set-up crew did their magic and had the 5 rinks that we needed all set up for us - how did they know?!?</p>
<p>This time we had participants come from Long Beach, Laguna Beach, Casta del Sol, Lake Hodges, Redlands, Hemet, Riverside &amp; of course, our own Sun City. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the SWWD for increasing the donation, whoever won, received at least the cost of the days bowling and in most cases MORE! &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 12 end game in the morning was won by the following ladies:</p>

<table width="300" class="results_3">

<p>Looks like we had a few of the same ladies win both in the am &amp; pm - good bowling!!</p>
<p>The last Ladies' Day of the year is the Christmas Luncheon/Bowling at Laguna Woods on December 10th.&nbsp; It is really important that I receive the list of names of the participants from your club by December 3rd so that I can let them know the next day what our count is. You can send me a copy of that sheet by e-mail - please include whether they are attending the luncheon only or will be bowling and what position they prefer.&nbsp; Then by Sunday the 6th I must have the final information - there will be no additions after that date.&nbsp; The cost for both the lunch &amp; bowling is $12 and it would be very helpful to have everyone paid by the deadline.&nbsp; How to make out the check and where to send it is listed on the sign-up sheet.&nbsp; You can find that on the <a href="http://swlawnbowls.org">swlawnbowls.org</a> website if you don't already have it.</p>
<p>Lunch will be served at Noon, so we are moving check-in time for bowling to no later than 8:30 am so that we can be finished in plenty of time.&nbsp; The dress for this day is Holiday casual and don't forget to pass on to those attending that we are requesting the donation of a wrapped gift to be included in the $1 per ticket raffle.&nbsp; The funds from this fun time benefits our SWWD treasury.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there.</p>

<h3>October 15, 2014 Ladies' Day at Newport Harbor</h3>
<p></p>
<p>It was a lovely day at Newport Harbor yesterday.&nbsp; The forecast was for 'mist' in the morning but after a few clouds the sun came out with a gentle breeze and all was well.&nbsp; I even arrived in plenty of time with lighter than usual traffic - was it a holiday ?!?!</p>
<p>Hospitality outdid themselves as usual with lots of choices for morning coffee as well as at lunch time.&nbsp; The green was already set up for us on rinks 2 through 5.&nbsp; I had my score cards numbered 1 through 4 &amp; used the same for the draw chips for leads &amp; vices.&nbsp; They figured that out easily.&nbsp; Well, for the afternoon, I thought I would fix that &amp; used numbers 2 through 5 in the draw chips but forgot to change the score cards.&nbsp; I sure caused a lot of confusion!&nbsp; But after explaining what I did, they considered the source &amp; the game was underway!</p>
<p>Before the morning game got started we played the SPIDER.&nbsp; After all the bowls were rolled, some hit the jack &amp; each others bowls, the one that wound up the closest was Shirley Price's and she won the $5!</p>
<p>The winners for the first game of 12 ends was:</p>
<p>1st place - Joanne Hedgespeth, Bernie Crabtree &amp; Yvonne Cannon<br>
2nd place - Cathy MacDonald, Carol Smith &amp; Carole Gray<br>
3rd place - Margi Rambo, Gloria Montes &amp; Jean Cochran</p>
<p>The afternoon game of 10 ends was won by:</p>
<p>1st place - Cecile Langevin &amp; Joan Phillips<br>
2nd place - Joanne Hedgespeth, Emily Carpenter &amp; Amy Chan<br>
3rd place - Margi Rambo &amp; Gloria Montes</p>
<p>I think everyone enjoyed themselves so you can all make plans to join us at the last two Ladies' Days of this year and they are Sun City on November 19th and our Christmas Luncheon &amp; bowling on December 10th at Laguna Woods.&nbsp; I usually don't send out the flyer for the next LD until after the previous one is done.&nbsp; However, with less than a month between the next two I will be sending out the Christmas flyer and sign-up sheet around the beginning of November, so watch for it and get it posted at your club.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all soon.</p>

<h3>September 24, 2014 Ladies' Day at Santa Ana</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I look forward to these Ladies' Days.&nbsp; It is a chance to get better acquainted with the ladies from different areas of Southern California whom we seldom see or maybe see at tournaments, where we are focused on the day and don't get to visit much.</p>
<p>Our trip took us a little longer than usual.&nbsp; The GPS took us to West Memory Lane instead of East.&nbsp; So by the time we figured out how to get to the correct place it was a little after 9 AM.&nbsp; Thank goodness Angie Salgado had everything under control.&nbsp; Everyone was checked in, paid, patiently waiting and taking advantage of the delicious goodies provided by Hospitality.&nbsp; Thank you so much.</p>
<p>The information I sent to Angie indicated that we would need only 3 rinks but when I made a few changes to my game plan with some additional ladies it worked out that we had 2 triples &amp; 2 doubles. Thanks to the Set-Up Crew, we immediately had a 4th rink.&nbsp; And Jan Hargraves stepped in to give me a hand when it came time to get the prize money together for the winners of both the morning &amp; afternoon games.&nbsp; It turned out to be a pretty WARM day so I thank everyone for hanging in there.</p>
<p>Prize money was won by the following:<br>
AM - 1st Pl: &nbsp; Lenora Jackson, Joanne Hedgespeth and Eula Casselman<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2nd Pl: Charlyn Moltane, Sheila Conti and Amy Chan<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3rd Pl: &nbsp;Margi Rambo and Shirley Cooper</p>
<p>PM - 1st Pl: &nbsp; Margi Rambo and Mary Clark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2nd Pl: Charlyn Moltane, Joann Hedgespeth and Shirley Cooper<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3rd Pl: &nbsp;Shirley Price, Gloria Montes and Amy Chan</p>
<p>The next time we get together for Ladies' Day is October 15th at Newport Harbor.&nbsp; The weather should be cooler by then so mark your calendars and lets make this a big day.&nbsp; While you have your calendars handy, put November 19th at Sun City in there and the final one for this year is the Christmas Luncheon and bowling in the morning at Laguna Woods on December 10th.&nbsp; Hopefully you will be able to make all three. The schedule and next month's LD flyer is on the SW website I am also attaching the flyer for October.</p>
<p>See you next month!</p>

<h3>August 20, 2014 Ladies' Day at Laguna Beach</h3>
<p></p>
<p>What a great day it turned out to be, but it didn't start out that way for us here in the Inland Empire. It was rain, hail, lightning &amp; thunder from about 2-6:30 am! &nbsp;I checked the Weather Channel for Laguna Beach and it said clear, sunny &amp; about 75 degrees, so off we went and so happy we did!</p>
<p>Laguna Beach LBC is in such a pristine area, we all look forward to going there. &nbsp;And this time we had 47 ladies in attendance. &nbsp;The greens were all set up for us and we spread out, using both. &nbsp; The Hospitality Committee and everyone that brought delightful refreshments - thank you so much. &nbsp;We all enjoyed and appreciated them.</p>
<p>The <u>morning</u> game wound up with a tie for 1st place between the teams of Cheryl Barkovich, Sandra Schlosser &amp; Amy Chan and Dixie Vanderloop, Elizabeth Austin &amp; Marlene Carpenter. &nbsp; 2nd place was a doubles game with Carol Poto &amp; Diana Justin taking the prize.</p>
<p>The <u>afternoon</u>&nbsp;game had 3 separate winners with Carol Poto, Bernie Crabtree &amp; Mary Freeman taking 1st place; Dixie Vanderloop, Sarah Case &amp; Nancy Stewart in 2nd place; and Shirley Price, Mary Porter &amp; Jan Shoemaker coming in 3rd.</p>
<p>We're so glad that Shirley is able to actively bowl again and she was a big help to me this time since I was delayed a bit. &nbsp;We miss Evelyn Lucero who always came to Ladies' Days. &nbsp;Please keep her in your thoughts &amp; prayers as she battles Cancer.</p>
<p>The next Ladies' Day is on September 24th at Santa Ana LBC. &nbsp;The reason it's on the 4th Wednesday is because the U.S. Open takes up the third week. &nbsp;I am including a copy of the flyer for Santa Ana. &nbsp;Please print and post it at your club. &nbsp;Let's see if we can keep up the great attendance. &nbsp;If you need a copy of the schedule for the rest of the year you can print it from the website.</p>
<p>See you all next time!!</p>

<h3>June 18, 2014 Ladies' Day at Holmby Park</h3>
<p>What a great day we had at Holmby Park. &nbsp;The setting was beautiful, with the Coral Tree and it's red flowers, the Lillies of the Nile purple blooms, the big Bird of Paradise and other foliage surrounding the green. &nbsp;Since this is close to Hollywood we had several open tour buses coming around. &nbsp;Maybe it will promote some interest to check out the game we were playing and find out why we were all dressed in white!</p>
<p>The hosting ladies did an outstanding job with Hospitality - lots of choices for both early morning and lunch time. &nbsp;The green was set up for us to start the games and we did, 'almost' on time. &nbsp;We had a few last minute changes with bowlers &amp; I forgot to remove the chips for the rink we were not using so the leads had to draw again! &nbsp;But it was all handled in a few minutes &amp; we were on to trial bowls.</p>
<p>We are able to pay three winners now, both AM and PM, with the increase in prize donation from SWWD. &nbsp;However, because of a problem with one of the cards, I am unable to accurately list the winners, but I know all those receiving a prize envelope was happy with the BIG MONEY!</p>
<p>There is no Ladies' Day scheduled for the month of July. &nbsp;In August we will be going to Laguna Beach. &nbsp;Be sure to download the flyer from the SW website and post at your club. &nbsp;This also is a beautiful location and August should be the perfect time to come and enjoy a day close to the ocean. &nbsp;The parking is metered, so bring some change.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing all of you again.</p>

<h3>May 21, 2014 Ladies' Day at Long Beach</h3>
<p>Another terrific day, this time at the Long Beach LBC. &nbsp;It was quite a bit cooler than the last couple of months but it didn't deter our enthusiasm. &nbsp;Isn't this weather crazy!?! &nbsp;The Jacaranda trees are in full bloom and they made a beautiful backdrop.</p>
<p>There were 39 ladies from 9 clubs, which gave us 6 triples and one double. &nbsp;I shared a game with Shirley Price who was able to attend for the first time after her fall and we were so happy to see her!</p>
<p>We enjoyed coffee and some delicious goodies before we got started and there was plenty of salads, desserts and fruit to enhance the lunches that we all brought. &nbsp;Thank you so much for the Hospitality. &nbsp;And we can't forget to thank those that made sure everything was set up on the green for us when the time came to get started with the game.</p>
<p>We had a total of $192 in prize money to split between the AM &amp; PM games and these are the winners!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>AM</u>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1st place - Joanne Hedgespeth, Candy DeFazio &amp; Ann Kirchberg<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2nd place - Mary Thompson, Bernie Crabtree &amp; Jean Winfield<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3rd place - Heidi Fernandez &amp; Terrie Ferretti</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <u>PM</u>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tie for 1st place - Cheryl Barkovich, Ellie Orewyler &amp; Jean Winfield<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Dee McSparran &amp; Candy DeFazio<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2nd place - Nancy Doss &amp; Ann Kirchberg</p>
<p>Next month will be at Holmby Park in West Los Angeles. &nbsp;I am including the flyer so you can print it &amp; post at your club and pass the word along to encourage more ladies to attend. &nbsp;It's a great way to get acquainted.</p>
<p>See you next month!</p>

<h3>April 16, 2014 Ladies' Day at Casta del Sol</h3>
<p>Another super fun day with 28 ladies in attendance. We had 5 first time attendees &amp; since we all had a good time I'm sure they will be coming back for future Ladies' Days.</p>
<p>The weather was gorgeous, the hospitality was great and thanks to the gentlemen for setting up the green for us. I even saw a couple of the men doing dishes!!</p>
<p>In the morning games we had one clear winner &amp; a tie. In the afternoon, we had 2 sets of ties so we actually paid out 4 prize envelopes. The raising of the SWWD prize money has made a nice difference.</p>
<p>I think I am making progress in putting names &amp; faces together. In looking at the picture I can name almost everyone. Give me a couple more times &amp; I'll be able to call you all by name. Now learning what club you are with may take me longer.</p>
<p>I hope that you all plan to go to many of the Ladies' Days. Talk with some of those that have attended &amp; they'll tell you about all the friends they are making.</p>
<p>See you in Long Beach on May 21st.</p>

<h3>March 19, 2014 Ladies' Day at Santa Anita</h3>
<p>We held the first Ladies' Day of 2014 at Santa Anita and it was a great success.  There were 38 ladies in attendance from 10 Southern California Clubs.  Of the 38 there were 5 at their first Ladies' Day and we hope it won't be their last.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, just like we ordered and the setting at Santa Anita with the flowering trees is beautiful, as well.  A big THANK YOU to them for their hospitality.</p>
<p>With the increase of the SWWD contribution to the prize money the winners in both the morning and afternoon games were very pleased.  This was my fledgling day as coordinator of this event and thanks to the help I received from a couple gals, I think I shall be able to carry on.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to more of the same with as good, if not better, attendance!  Come on out and enjoy. </p>

<h3>December 18, 2013 Holiday Luncheon at Laguna Woods</h3>

<hr />

<h3>November 20, 2013 Ladies' Day at Sun City</h3>

<p>The count at Sun City on November 20 was small but the enthusiasm was large! The AM game had 16 count which meant Australian Pairs could be played…and for some it was a first time event. In the PM game, three Triple games were played with two teams having 11 points to tie for first place.</p>
<p>In between games, the men members of Sun City hosted the lunch room offering delicious chicken tortilla soup and other home-made goodies.</p>
<p>Next up is the Holiday lunch on Wednesday, December 11. As in other years, it will be at Laguna Woods with the luncheon in Clubhouse #2 near Gate #12. Flyers and signup sheets are posted at each club with more details. However, all reservations are due by December 5 as Laguna Woods must have the names of all guests.</p>
<p>See you all December 11 and thanks for a great year of Ladies' Day!</p>

<h3>October 9, 2013 Ladies' Day at Newport Harbor</h3>
<p><img src="ladies_day/2013_pic_10_13_Newport_300.png" width="300" height="410" class="floatRight">The attendance on Wednesday, October 9, for Ladies' Day at Newport Harbor was 30 women from eight clubs. Rain was forecast but the turnout included Micky Alexander and Nancy Doss from Sun City and Pauline Renshaw and Barbara Clark from Hermosa Beach. A short rain shower in the second game took us off the green for a few minutes so a Happy Birthday was sung to Freddie Hinson of Long Beach who then cut the cake celebrating her 90th birthday.</p>
<p>The morning game winners were Pauline Renshaw, Jean Winfield and Nancy Doss in 1st place…Pauline Kozma, Patty Lucas and Christy Diller in 2nd…and Jan Hargraves, Sandy Focht and Evelyn Lucero. The afternoon game was ten ends due to weather and winners were Dee McSparran, Jackie Huisman and Dottie Lewis…2nd game winners were Pauline Renshaw, Sally Cadwallader and Harriet Bemus... while 3rd team was Shirley Price, Jean Winfield and Christy Diller.</p>
<p>The next Ladies' Day will be Wednesday, November 20, at Sun City. Please make an effort to get a carpool together to support the Sun City ladies who have come to EVERY Ladies' Day this year except Santa Monica.</p>
<p>Club delegates will be contacted shortly regarding next year's Ladies' Day schedule. If for any reason your club cannot participate, or if your club WANTS to be included, please let me know.</p>
<p>Our Holiday luncheon will be December 11th at Laguna Woods. This is the 2nd Wednesday of the month.</p>

<h3>September 11, 2013 Ladies' Day at Casta del Sol</h3>

<p>Weather-wise – much cooler…attendance – 25 Southwest Women's Division members from eight clubs evenly divided into skill levels of Skips, Vices and Leads. The AM game of 14 ends was won by Dee McSparran, JoAnn La Frenais and Carrie Reach, a novice from Newport Harbor. The 10-end game after lunch also was won by Dee with Mary Thompson in a Pairs game. Let's hope the winning by Dee will continue during the Scottish-USA Test Match Series scheduled for September 17-19!</p>
<p>The next Ladies' Day will be at Newport Harbor LBC on Wednesday, October 9 (sign-up sheet attached). Please note this is again the second Wednesday of the month due to our busy SW Division tournament schedule.</p>

<h3>August 21, 2013 Ladies' Day at Laguna Beach</h3>

<h3>June 19, 2013 Ladies' Day at Santa Monica</h3>

<p>The attendance may have been small but the 24 members from seven clubs had a fun day with many laughs, good food and getting acquainted with the three "first timers". Santa Monica and Holmby Park each had eight members attend while the remaining eight carpooled from Beverly Hills, Laguna Beach, Long Beach and Santa Anita.</p>
<p>The morning Triples game of 14 ends was won by Betsy Lauryssen with help from Chris Dunn and Lucy Brewer. The afternoon 12-end game of "No Short Bowls" also was won by Betsy and Chris with Molly Smulian as lead.</p>
<p>It definitely was beach weather with delicious salads and desserts and, as always, the Santa Monica hospitality was great. Terrie Ferretti cannot return to bowls for a few more weeks, but greeted everyone and handled the check-ins. Dixie Vanderloop and her crew made sure everyone had plenty to eat and a big thanks also goes to Amo Garcia for setting up the greens and taking the photo which is attached.</p>
<p>There will be no Ladies' Day in July but members are encouraged to sign up and participate in the Pairs Playdowns in Santa Ana which start July 13th.</p>
<p>The next Ladies' Day will be in Laguna Beach on August 21 and flyers will be sent in late July.</p>

<h3>December 12, 2012 Holiday Luncheon at Laguna Woods</h3>
<p>HOLIDAY LUNCHEON A HUGE SUCCESS!</p>
<img src="ladies_day/2012_pic_12_12_Laguna_Woods.jpg" alt="Holiday Luncheon" width="512" height="384" class="fltrt">
<p>Our 2012 SWWD Holiday Luncheon was, as always, a day of good fellowship and camaraderie. The weather was "our kind" and 72 members played Triples on the Laguna Woods greens from 9-11 AM.</p>
<p>We were greeted at the clubhouse by pianist Charlyn Moltane playing Christmas selections and 19 more members arrived to make a count of 91 having a delicious lunch. President Melanie Vizenor with help from Vice President Georgie Deno "ran" the raffle tickets for the gifts…Charlyn performed her now classic skit…and Shirley Price bestowed Treasurer Dee McSparran with a small trophy titled "Always Giving Back".</p>
<p>There were many first-timers there including Ann Loranger of Casta del Sol who won the quilted holiday tabletop runner made and donated by Heather Stewart.</p>
<p>In 2013 the first Ladies' Day will be held at Santa Anita LBC on Wednesday, March 20th, so mark your calendars now.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all our SWWD members!</p>

<h3>November 14, 2012 Ladies' Day at Sun City</h3>
<p>Ladies' Day at Sun City on November 14 was a bright, warm day. While 23 members from eight clubs were present, ten were from Sun City…a club which has consistently attended the Ladies' Day events this year. Also, it is the third club this year where the men have taken over the lunch duties so their members can participate.</p>

<p>The date of 12/12/12 is easy to remember as the SWWD annual Holiday luncheon at Laguna Woods. Check in at 8:30 AM for bowls 9-11 AM.</p>

<p>If you can attend the luncheon only, plan on arriving at 11 AM as lunch will be served at 12 NN. Information and sign-up sheets have been sent to club delegates and the cost of $12.00 per person remains the same as prior years.</p>

<p>Also, if weather is unsuitable for bowls that morning, then we will see you at 11 AM…the place is same as other years, Clubhouse #2 at Laguna Woods, entrance at Gate #12.</p>

<p>Come join us and get in the Holiday spirit!

<p>A big thank-you to Casta del Sol for hosting the September 19 Ladies' Day. It was a pleasure to return to their lovely facility and the members did a great job of welcoming. Our thanks to Mary Thompson, president of Casta del Sol, for making all the arrangements. </p>

<p>In attendance were 26 members from ten clubs and while the temperature was high, so was the enthusiasm. And a thank you also to Colleen Jenkins and Sandy Focht from our club who attended.</p>

<p>The next Ladies' Day will be at Newport Beach club on Wednesday, October 17th.</p>

<p>Notices have been sent and are posted at each club. Please encourage new bowlers to attend.</p>

<p>Other dates for SWWD events to finish this year are Ladies' Day at Sun City on November 14th and our Holiday luncheon on December 12 at Laguna Woods.</p>

<h3>August 15, 2012 Ladies' Day at Laguna Beach</h3>

<p>On August 15, 34 SWWD members from 11 clubs enjoyed Ladies' Day in the cooler weather at Laguna Beach. Sun City arrived with three and Newport had the most with nine attending. The men from Laguna Beach hosted the hospitality, being responsible for the green setup with many umbrellas…the lunch menu with delicious desserts (along with Heather's Heavenly Hash)…and the cleanup both inside and on the greens. A "treat" provided was a cooler packed with water and a sign reading, "Free to the ladies, with love, from the men."</p>

<p>The next Ladies' Day will be hosted by Casta del Sol LBC on September 19. This is an easy to reach gated community in Mission Viejo. The flyers being sent to delegates include driving directions, so get your carpools together and try to include a "first timer" for Ladies' Day.

<h3>June 20, 2012 Ladies' Day at Santa Monica</h3>

<p>While Shirley is on vacation, she will be happy to hear that ladies of the SWWD were graciously welcomed by members of Santa Monica LBC for yesterday's Ladies' Day. Representatives of clubs from Beverly Hills, Hermosa Beach, Holmby Park, Long Beach, Newport Harbor, Oxnard and Santa Monica donned their whites and graced the green with a 14-end game in the morning and a 10-end game after lunch. With only one first-time Ladies' Day participant, there were several ladies who enjoyed their first time to Santa Monica LBC.</p>
<p>Kudos to Terrie Ferretti and Cheryl Barkovich for being so organized and time-efficient with the Draw. Thanks to Dixie Vanderloop, Barbara Wallace and their hospitality helpers for a lovely lunch spread. Club President Stu Bell came to welcome the group and take the attached photo. Member and greens keeper Amo Garcia was there to set up the rinks and help wherever needed. There were even a few club member spectators.</p>
<p>Next month takes us to San Diego LBC located in beautiful Balboa Park. Please print and post the attached sign-up sheet at your clubhouse. Most importantly, encourage ladies of your club to participate. They're sure to enjoy the experience of bowling on different greens with other friendly ladies of the SWWD.</p>
<p>Happy bowling,</p>

<h3>May 16, 2012 Ladies' Day at Long Beach</h3>

<p>The weather was a Spring day at its best in Long Beach and the North green was fast, which made it quite a contrast for those used to slower greens. Eleven clubs were represented with 40 playing the AM 14-end game and 37 in the PM 10-end game.
<p>The Long Beach members are always hospitable and Wednesday the men were in charge, meaning not only they do the set up of the greens, but also prepared and served the lunch, did the kitchen clean-up and put away the equipment. Such commitment means the ladies of the club can bowl without trying to get food ready or be concerned with anything other than having fun on the green!
<p>The next Ladies' Day will be Wednesday, June 20, at Santa Monica. Their club delegates, Terrie Ferretti and Dixie Vanderloop, will be handling the reservations and all details are on the Ladies' Day flyer.
